# JourneyBox Fixes - Completed Tasks

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. SnackBar Off-Screen Error
- **Issue**: SnackBar was appearing off-screen with "Floating SnackBar presented off screen" error
- **Root Cause**: Default floating behavior with insufficient space in Scaffold layout
- **Solution**: Added `behavior: SnackBarBehavior.fixed` to SnackBar in home_screen.dart
- **File Modified**: `lib/screen/home_screen.dart`

### 2. PDF File Opening Problem
- **Issue**: PDF files in itinerary attachments were not opening properly
- **Root Cause**: Using `launchUrl` with file URI which doesn't work reliably for local files
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `open_file: ^3.3.2` dependency to pubspec.yaml
  - Updated `_openAttachment` method in trip_details_screen.dart to use `OpenFile.open()` for PDF and DOCX files
  - Added proper import for open_file package
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `pubspec.yaml` (added dependency)
  - `lib/trip/trip_details_screen.dart` (updated import and file opening logic)

## ✅ Dependencies Updated
- Added `open_file: ^3.3.2` to pubspec.yaml
- Ran `flutter pub get` to install dependencies

## ✅ Testing Recommendations
- Test PDF opening in itinerary attachments
- Test SnackBar display when saving trips fails
- Verify no off-screen SnackBar errors occur
- Test on different device sizes to ensure layout compatibility

## Notes
- Images still use the existing dialog preview functionality
- Other file types (PDF, DOCX) now use the open_file plugin for better compatibility
- All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality
